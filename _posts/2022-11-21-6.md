title: "Cartels"
---



This week we will turn our attention to the study of cartels. Firms form cartels in order to reduce competition and increase profits. We will study the firms' incentive to collude in our models of oligopolistic markets. We will see that there needs to be a long-run relationship between firms to make collusion a "stable" outcome in the sense of there being an (appropriately chosen) equilibrium in which firms cooperate.

**Introduction**

We start off with some background information about cartels, what they are, what they do, and we look a bit more closely at how they operate in practice.

**Collusion in a static Cournot oligopoly**

We now look at the static Cournot game too see if there is any scope for collusion. It turns out there is not. Strategically, collusion in a Cournot game turns out to be similar to a Prisoner's Dilemma: "cheating" is a strictly dominant strategy!

**Collusion in a finitely repeated Cournot oligopoly**

Since the static game does not allow for collusion, what about if we repeat the game a few times...?
